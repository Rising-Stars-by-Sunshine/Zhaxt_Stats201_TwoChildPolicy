# Future Research Directions

The result of this project is apparent and consistent with our predictions. However, it seems not enough to reach a conclusion from current results. There are some further research directions.

Background: There is a stock that may be affected by the Two-child Policy, which is the leading company in the Chinese maternal and child market. But it is not persuasive because the performance of Beingmate may be a coincidence.

## Direction 1

Research question: Are there any other stocks in the maternal and child market affected by the Two-child policy?

Method: With more stocks to be considered, a portfolio of stocks in the maternal and child market can be achieved. Using the error (probably L2 norm) of the portfolio as the estimation of results, a better index is created and then tested around the event.

Potential result: The whole industry portfolio follows / not follow the performance of Beingmate, that is the Two-child Policy does/does not affect the field.

Contribution: This direction will help people better understand the pattern of the whole maternal and child market.

## Direction 2

Research question 2: Are there better ways to keep track of the performance of stocks in this case?

Method: Other methods like Decision Trees (Using stock price or returns as a target, split the data based on features representing various factors affecting stock prices, such as market trends, investor sentiment, or geopolitical events.)

Potential result: After a better description of Beingmate stocks, the effect of the Two-child Policy is more apparent.

Contribution: This direction will help people better understand stocks and their reaction to events in China.
