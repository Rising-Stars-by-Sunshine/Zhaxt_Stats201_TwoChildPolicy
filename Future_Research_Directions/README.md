# Future Research Directions

The result of this project is apparent and consistent with our predictions. However, it seems not enough to reach a conclusion from current results. There are some further research directions.

Background: There is a stock that may be affected by the Two-child Policy, which is the leading company of Chinese maternal and child market. But it is not persuasive because the performance of Beingmate may be a coincidence.

## Direction 1

Research question: Are there any other stocks in maternal and child market affected by the Two-child policy?

Method: With more stocks to be considered, portfolio of stocks in maternal and child market can be achieved. Using the error (probably L2 norm) of the portfolio as the estimation of results, a better index is created then tested around the event.

Potential result: The whole industry portfolio follows / not follows the performance of Beingmate, that is the Two-child Policy do / do not affected the field.

Contribution: This direction will help people better understand the pattern of the whole maternal and child market.

## Direction 2

Research question 2: Are there better ways to keep track of the performance of stocks in this case?

Method: Other methods like Decision Trees (Using stock price or returns as target, split the data based on features representing various factors affecting stock prices, such as market trends, investor sentiment, or geopolitical events.)

Potential result: After better description of Beingmate stocks, the effect of the Two-child Policy is more apparent.

Contribution: This direction will help people better understand stocks and their reaction to events in China.
