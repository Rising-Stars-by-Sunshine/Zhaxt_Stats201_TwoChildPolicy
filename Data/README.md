Considering the time required for a child to be born, and avoiding the overall environmental turbulence in China (such as the 2018 financial crisis), the data is divided into pre-event (2015.10.30 - 2016.8.30) and post-event (2016.8.30 - 2017.6.30) categories. All data is time-series, with frequency of pre trading day.
